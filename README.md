# Expo Android Crash Reproduction

A minimal reproduction repository demonstrating a critical issue where Expo Updates causes crash-on-launch behavior on Android 7 devices when using Expo SDK 52 with Expo Updates versions below 0.26.13.

## Issue Overview

This repository provides a minimal test case to reproduce and verify a compatibility issue between:

- Expo SDK 52
- Expo Updates (versions < 0.26.13)
- Android 7 (Nougat) devices

The app will crash immediately upon launch under these conditions, making it useful for debugging and verifying the fix.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
